# Auto-LaTeX-Equations

Auto-LaTeX Equations add-on for Google Docs

## Setup

You need to get the .clasp.json files within Docs/, Slides/, and Sheets/ by dm'ing Aayush.

clasp is used to sync your local folder with the actual code sandbox in the Google Doc/Slide/whatever that's eventually published. We use Github for development with multiple people. You can `clasp push -w` which will live update the code in the Google sandbox so you dont have to deal with push/pull anymore.
